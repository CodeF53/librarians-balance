## The issue...

Ever found librarians to be a little too tedious and overpowered? It's never been fun to sit there for minutes at a time, rerolling their trades to get the one you need. And it gets way too easy to obain powerful enchantments that should have reflected your dedication to the game. 

I thought that this part of Minecraft really needed a rebalance, so this is what I came up with.

# Introducing: Librarian's Balance

Librarian's Balance comes in the form of a simple datapack, and adds couple of things to solve this issue.

### Featuring...

1. **Customizable Trades:** Put an enchanted book on a Librarian's Lectern, and their first or second selling trade will change accordingly! This only works if they already have a book in one of those slots.

2. **Limited Trades:** Librarians' trades are capped to a level of 3. The only way of obtaining a higher level trade is by providing them with it. Combine the books you want in an Anvil, or find them in the world.

3. **Rare Mending:** Librarians do not trade for Mending, so you'll have to find it yourself. Mending is now found more commonly in structures such as dungeons and Bastions. It's about as rare as the Otherside music disc, Soul Speed, or Swift Sneak in Ancient Cities.

Everything i've listed is completely configurable. So if you just want a selection of these things or if you want to change a value, you can!

## Uses

I imagine that this would be particlarly useful on an SMP, where you'd want to extend the midgame a little bit more to keep things interesting. After all, there's always that *one guy* who gets max everything in 2 days. Now imagine the chaos when somebody founds a source of Mending!

### Note:

You may see the UI show a mending or >3 enchantment sometimes. It's purely visual, so you can ignore it. This is my first datapack, so i'd appreciate it if you wanted to contribute or give feedback. 

I built this datapack upon a bit of gibbsly's [Lectern Enchanting](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/lectern-enchanting/). I would SUPER like to thank him for this and some of his tutorials on YouTube, because without it I would probably have had no idea where to start on making something like this.
